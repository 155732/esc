Simple OOP benchmarks and optimization levels
=============================================

The goal of this exercise is to understand the relative cost of various C++
operations and the effect of different compiler optimization levels.  You
should:

1. Inspect the two benchmark-\* files linked below

2. Make sure you understand everything that is being done

3. Compile with different optimization levels (-O0, -O1, ..., -O3)

4. Do you obtain the same results shown in the presentation?

5. Interpret any discrepancies you see.
