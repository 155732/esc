Getting Around
==============

Use GCC and the Intel compiler for these exercises.  **REMEMBER TO SOURCE THE
SOURCEME.SH FILE!**::

  source sourceme.sh

You have an extra script at your disposal in the working directory, called
``pfmon_deluxe.py``, which simplifies obtaining results for some exercises.
You’re welcome to use it, if needed, i.e. (remembering the quotes)::

  ./pfmon_deluxe.py -e "./full_cms bench_esc.g4"

In cases where it’s needed, try using Pfmon Deluxe with different options to
obtain more measurements (using ``–f simd1`` or ``–f simd2`` when necessary).
